# ECG removal from sEMG by FCN
Electrocardiogram (ECG) artifact contamination often occurs in surface electromyography (sEMG) applications when the measured muscles proximate the heart. Previous studies have developed various methods to tackle this problem, such as high-pass filter, template subtraction and so forth. However, these methods still have some limitations and challenges, such as the requirement of reference signals and distortion in the original sEMG signals. This work proposed a novel denoise method to remove ECG artifacts from the single-channel sEMG signals using fully convolution networks (FCN). The proposed method adopted a denoise autoencoder structure and the powerful nonlinear mapping capability of neural networks for sEMG denoising. We compared the proposed approach with conventional approaches, including high-pass filters and template subtraction, on open datasets called Non-Invasive Adaptive Prosthetics sEMG database and MIT-BIH Normal Sinus Rhythm Database. The experimental results show that FCN outperformed conventional methods in sEMG reconstruction quality under a wide range of SNR input.
